// The native gate: every program in a corpus, rendered by the NATIVE host and
// by Chrome's DOM backend, compared, and held against a recorded baseline.
//
// WHY A BASELINE AND NOT A THRESHOLD. Native text will never be byte-identical
// to Skia's, and the residual differs per program — a page of prose sits higher
// than a page of rectangles. A single global threshold would either pass
// everything or fail the text-heavy programs forever. So each program records
// what it currently is, and the gate fails on REGRESSION against that number.
// Improvements are reported and, with --bless, written back.
//
//   node gate.mjs                 # check against baseline
//   node gate.mjs --bless         # record current numbers as the baseline
//   node gate.mjs --only arc,blur # a subset
//   node gate.mjs --lanes 1       # one program at a time (default: 6 lanes —
//                                 # windows of their own, measured side by side)
//
// The app is navigated IN PROCESS (`__declareBoot`) rather than relaunched, so
// a whole corpus costs one launch — its own, when no controllable host is
// running (window at the back, light appearance, closed at the end).
//
// WHERE THE PROGRAMS COME FROM. The gate measures the tree it sits in, and
// serves it itself. The host opens most programs from disk (`file:`), the way
// a person opens a .declare file; the few in OVER_HTTP it opens from a plain
// static server the gate starts — files and 404s, no compiler — because the
// host compiles for itself and must find includes and assets by relative
// address there too. Chrome, the reference side, loads every program from a
// Declare server the gate starts on the same tree.
